# Linux CPU instruments  
A set of utilities for setting logic CPU parameters.  

You can set:  
* Governor
* Min/max frequency
* Max/mix governor frequency

This program works with GNU/Linux pseudo files, no asm magic here.  
You should launch this tool with **root** privileges if you want to change core parameters.  
And remember, **this program is WIP.**
